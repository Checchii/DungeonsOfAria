/*
The step event is basically the game loop.
This event is checked every single frame of the game. 
( In my case 60 frames a second )

here is where we can check certain conditions and inputs. 

we can check to see if the player is pressing a key and if so do a corresponding action

we can also check if the player is colliding with a wall object or an enemy object.

if the former is true then we remove the player's movement in the direction the wall is. 

if the latter is true then we reduce the player's health value.
